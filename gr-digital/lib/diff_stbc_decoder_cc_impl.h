/*! \brief Decodes an incoming stream after the rules of a differential
 * Space Time Block Code (STBC).
 *
 * The differential STBC decoder works with 'sequences' of length 2, decoding them
 * into a code sequence of length 2.
 * The number of input items is automatically scheduled to a multiple of 2, however,
 * if the input data stream is terminated, the absolute number of input items
 * must be an even number.
 * When running with an infinite sequence stream, the differential STBC decoder is a sync
 * block which produces the same amount of output items as there are input items.
 * The code rate is R=1.
 * If a finite block of sequences is transmitted, the decoder needs a reference sequence
 * to differentially decode the first sequence. When using stream tags with key
 * on the stream, the decoder therefore produces one sequence less than it consumes, because
 * the tagged sequence is skipped and taken as reference to differentially decode the first
 * sequence after the tag as first decoded output sequence. If there is no tag at the very
 * first sequence of the transmission, the decoder uses a dummy sequence (= basis vectors of
 * basis transformation 'd_basis_vecs') to decode the first sequence. Generally this leads
 * to a wrong decoded first symbol. The following symbols are decoded correctly.
 * To avoid a wrong decoded first symbol, there must be a stream tag on the first
 * incoming sequence.
 * You can set a correct stream tag in a C++ block like in the following example,
 * where offset stands for the item position of the tag in the current output buffer of a call of the work function:
 * add_item_tag(0, nitems_written(0) + offset, pmt::mp("start"), 0);
 *
 * The incoming samples are expected to be PSK modulated samples of any modulation order.
 * If the constellation is phase shifted, meaning that there is no constellation point
 * on the real axis, this must be stated by setting the input argument 'phase_offset'
 * to the phase (in radians) of one of the constellation points.
 *
 * The algorithm of this differential STBC follows [1]. Briefly, this STBC
 * is the differential version of the well known Alamouti Code.
