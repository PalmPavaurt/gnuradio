/*! \brief Encodes an incoming stream after the rules of a differential
 * Space Time Block Code (STBC), producing two output streams.
 *
 * The differential STBC encoder works with sequences of length 2, encoding them
 * into a code sequence of length 2 at each of the two output branches, respectively.
 * The number of input items is automatically scheduled to a multiple of 2, however,
 * if the input data stream is terminated, the absolute number of input items
 * must be an even number.
 * The differential STBC encoder is a sync block which produces the same amount of
 * output items at each port as there are input items. The code rate is R=1.
 *
 * The incoming samples are expected to be PSK modulated samples of any modulation order.
 * If the constellation is phase shifted, meaning that there is no constellation point
 * on the real axis, this must be stated by setting the input argument 'phase_offset'
 * to the phase (in radians) of one of the constellation points.
 *
 * The algorithm of this differential STBC follows [1]. Briefly, this STBC
 * is the differential version of the well known Alamouti Code.
